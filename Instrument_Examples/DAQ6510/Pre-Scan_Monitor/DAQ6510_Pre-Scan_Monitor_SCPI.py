	Many products need to be environmentally-stressed during performance testing. This is accomplished
        by placing the device in a chamber where the temperature can be set and controlled and soaking the
        DUT at the required set-point conditions. Temperature changes are not instantaneous so there is
        some wait time between scans. The DAQ6510 can monitor the environment until the target
        temperature has been reached at which point the instrument automatically begins the scan.
        
        This application example demonstrates how to use a DAQ6510 to initiate a scan based on the
        temperature of the environment around the device under test (DUT). This example will model a
        situation where resistance DUTs are measured after the temperature exceeds 30 Â°C.
