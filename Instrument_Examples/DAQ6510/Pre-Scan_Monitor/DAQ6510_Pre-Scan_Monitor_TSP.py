	There are three different multiplex modules available for use with the
	DAQ6510. This application example demonstrates how each of the multiplexer
	modules can impact productivity by changing test time. The multiplexer modules
	all share the same basic code base for switching, scanning, and measuring.
	Any limits on system speed are the result of the relays in the multiplexer
	that switch the signals from the device under test (DUT) into the instrument.

        The Model 7700 20-Channel Differential Multiplexer Module uses electromechanical
        relays which have low contact resistance and contribute only a minor offset
        potential (<1 Ω through the end of life and < 500 nV, respectively). This
        results in the most accurate readings of the modules but with a 3 ms relay
        closure time, the slowest scan time in comparison to other options.

        The 7703 multiplexer module uses reed relays which have low contact resistance
        (<1 Ω through the end of life), but a higher contact potential (6 μV max)
        which contributes more signal offset and slightly less precise readings.
        The benefit of this module is shorter relay close time (less than 1 ms) which
        makes it approximately three times faster than the 7700.

        The 7710 multiplexer module uses solid-state relays which have the highest
        contact resistance and contact potential of the three options (<5 Ω and
        <1 μV, respectively) and are therefore the least precise, however the 7710
        has the overall speed advantage with a relay close time of less than 0.5
        ms, making it twice as fast as the 7703 and at least six times faster than
        the 7700.
